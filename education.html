            <h1>My Educational Background</h1>
            <p>Cardiff University (Year 2 - current): Computer Science BSc - On the Computer Science BSc, we learn how data is stored, processed, applied, and kept secure by information processing systems. We also develop a grounding in programming languages, databases, operating systems, graphics, robotics, and other sophisticated technologies, as well as exploring software engineering subjects such as software development.</p>
            <p>Utrecht University (Netherlands): Data Science: Applied Text Mining (summer course 2022) - This course introduced the basic and advanced concepts and ideas in text mining and natural language processing. In this course, we learned how to apply text mining methods on text data and analyze them in a pipeline with machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Programming languages such as Python and R were used.</p>
            <p>Utrecht University (Netherlands): Data Science: Network Science (summer course 2022) - The objective of the course was to acquire hands-on knowledge of how to analyze different types of networks. Students were able to understand when a network approach is useful, understand diverse types of networks, understand the differences and similarities between a Complex Networks and a Social Network Analysis approach, describe network characteristics, infer edges or node attributes, and explore dynamical processes in networks.</p>
            <p>Dudley College (2018-2020): BTEC LEVEL 3 Extended diploma IT - In this course, we were taught a wide range of subjects covering the diverse aspects of computing including programming, analysis, design, computer architecture, networking, database design, social media, and cyber security.</p>
