                <h2>E-commerce Website</h2>
                <p>The aim of this project was to construct a website for an online shop. The website allows customers to browse through the available goods, view their price and all other relevant information, add the goods to the shopping basket, and finally view the basket (with selected items displayed and their total price) and allow customers to enter payment details. No real payment mechanism was implemented to avoid financial liability. This project helped me build front-end website construction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as server-side development using scripting languages such as Python and frameworks like Flask.</p>

                <h2>Diagnostic Assistant Tool (In Progress)</h2>
                <p>Creating a machine learning project to develop a web-based application for medical diagnosis. The goal is to use NLP for symptom input processing and machine learning algorithms for generating diagnostic suggestions. Technologies to be used include Python for machine learning (TensorFlow), web technologies such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, and backend development such as Flask.</p>
