            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Shadid Salehin, a dedicated student at Cardiff University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My journey in this field is driven by my passion for cybersecurity and data analysis, areas where I find both challenges and opportunities for innovation.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>From the moment I pressed those keyboard buttons on a warm summer evening in Bangladesh, playing an old flash game in my cousin‚Äôs room, I knew my world had changed. I was only 5, yet these square machines made me excited as a child‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. wait I was a child! üòÇ.</p>
            <p>As years passed my fascination with computers and technology only grew, I became an avid gamer, but I also started to ask more and more question about their mechanics; ‚Äúhow this machine knows what image to show, How!!, does this machine show these images in the first place? These questions where the seeds for my love of computing and technology. I saw machines not just as tools, but as gateway to myriad possibilities. I always dreamt I would do something great in this field and carve my name in tech history.</p>
            <p>When I choose computer science as a degree, it was a no brainer. No one in my family was surprised, I still remember my mother chiding me when I was little for having my face glued to the screen all the time, she really was worried about the hours I ‚Äúwasted‚Äù (in her words), front of the screen, but little did she know this would become my portal to innovation and discovery.</p>
            <p>Around 2020, just before my university would start; my father passed away due to cancer. This was a great blow in my life, as my father worked tirelessly all the time to make sure my family and I had everything we needed. I saw his last few years suffer due to the intense toll cancer took on his body, and the day he died; I made a promise to myself. I would try everything in my being to reduce human suffering as much as possible. We humans have the ability of great wonder, we went from throwing rocks, to throwing rockets at the moon. Our possibilities are endless. One of the reasons why I want to use my passion and abilities in computer science to help as many people as possible from protecting them by stopping hazardous cyber-attacks, or to mix artificial intelligence and medicine to make more efficient disease or surgery control. The possibilities are endless; and so is my motivation.</p>
            <p>As a budding developer, I've also embarked on exciting projects like building an e-commerce website and developing a machine learning-based Diagnostic Assistant Tool. These projects have not only bolstered my technical skills but also honed my problem-solving abilities.</p>

            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>Computers arent my only hobby, I also love to read, both fiction and non- fiction. One of my favourite  book would be is The fellowship of the ring. I am also am into fitness, a healthy body is a healthy mind. I love working out and I also delve into Martial arts.</p>
